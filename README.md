Titanium Assignment
•	RESTFUL API endpoints to connect to an application layer
•	Interact with DB layer for GET and POST data from and to data layer
•	Simulate multizone DB layer redundancy.

Architecture

The above diagram shows the current implementation of system and its components

There are multiple approaches that can be implemented to sync between Data layer and multiple data sources.
1.	The data layer can be used to treat all data sources (databases) as independent and sync between them.


API layer

•	Controller with GET and POST api endpoints to connect to server and application

Application layer

•	Services and backend structure to define endpoint interfaces.

Streaming service

•	To communication asynchronously and handle large requests between microservices

DB layer

•	A infra consisting of Repositories and database configurations to control and commit between multiple data sources, in this case – 2 sqlite databases.


End points
•	http://localhost:8080/all
o	  Get all details from primary or any available cluster
•	http://localhost:8080/entityemp/<empname>
o  	Insert a new entity with name in URL
•	http://localhost:8080/entity/<empid>
o	  Get details of emp id in url
•	http://localhost:8080/syncEngines
o	  Sync all databases when LRC is enabled
